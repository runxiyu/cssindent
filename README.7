.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
I needed to write some CSS to style an HTML rendering of some man
pages. I asked for a CSS prettifier that works offline in #web, and that
could be hooked up to vim to prettify on save. And I was called a troll
because "web dev needs web, duh". (There are nice people in #web, and
this is not directed towards #web.)

So here's a fucking program to indent CSS. It's not perfect, I'm not
going to read 65535 pages of W3C specifications, but it works for my
purposes.
